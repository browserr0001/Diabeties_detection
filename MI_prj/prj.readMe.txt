The project is about using a machine learning algorithm to predict if a person is diabetic or not.
We use logistic regression and support vector machine for doing the same.
During pre-processing we have identified the outliers and checked for their influence on the dataset to 
make sure the accuracy is in check.
The code submitted is a jupyter notebook file and can be run on kaggle.
